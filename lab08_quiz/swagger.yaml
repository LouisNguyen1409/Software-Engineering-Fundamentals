    API written for lab08_quiz.
    
    This is only for your convenience. For any mistakes or inconsistency with the specification (README.md), please report to us on the course forum :).
    
    Please examine the 'example' return values carefully - for example, the GET quiz/:quizid route requires your object to be wrapped in a 'quiz' key.
    
    A 401 error should always have priority over a 400 error.
    
    Also, feel free to ignore the names of some of the schemas at the bottom of this file - this is only a label. To find out what each route takes in as input and returns, you instead should look at the "Example Value" within each route.
